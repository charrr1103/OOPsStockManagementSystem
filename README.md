Java OOPs Stock Management System (Groupwork):

A stock management system (SMS) in Java using Eclipse IDE and object-oriented programming concepts. 
The main objective of the SMS is to keep track and manage stock on a continual basis for a shop that sells two products 
(refrigerators and TVs). 

- Display the Welcome to the SMS, the current date and time and names of group member 
(in alphabetical order). 
- Allow user to input their full name.  
- Check if a user would like to add any products.  
- If user wish to add products, the program should prompt and require user to enter a number to add the product(s).
- Then, the program should display a menu option contains all the product selections (Refrigerator and TV).
- Provide intuitive input method that allows users to select a product, and then prompt the user to enter the values of the variables and use them to create an instance of the Product class so that user can add new entry. 
- If user do not wish to add any products, the program should prompt a request and require user to enter a zero value to exit the program. 
- Display the menu option whether to view products, add stock, deduct stock, discontinue a product, or do nothing (Exit) after all the products were added to the system. Check if a user is making valid selection. Execute the appropriate methods that you have defined in the StockManagement class (whether to view products, add stock, deduct stock, or discontinue product) based on user selection. 
- Display the generated user ID and their name when user exits the system.
